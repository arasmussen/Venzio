          <h1>A platform for WebGL games</h1>
          <div id="bubble">
            <h2>A new age for video games</h2>
            <p>With new technologies for the browser (see <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/webgl/">WebGL</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAPI/Pointer_Lock">Pointer Lock</a>, and <a href="http://socket.io/">Socket.IO</a>), developing and distributing a game is easier than ever.</p>
            <ul id="benefits">
              <li>Easy Access: instead of users having to reluctantly download and install your game, your game is just one click away.</li>
              <li>Cross-Platform: you have no platform specific code and your game will soon be supported by every major operating system and <a href="http://caniuse.com/webgl">desktop browser</a> from day one.</li>
              <li>JavaScript: develop using a flexible high-level language with a huge online community that has arguably fewer and simpler bugs than Java and C++.</li>
              <li>The Web: the internet was built to be networked and has a massive amount of functionality either already built in or just a git clone away, from payments to sockets.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>But making a game is still hard...</h2>
            <p class="padBottom">This is where we come in. We're here to give you as much as we can to keep you focusing on writing your gameplay specific code.</p>
            <p class="padBottom">We've written <a href="/demo">the skeleton of a 3D WebGL game</a> which has a working initial stab at physics and multiplayer. On top of that, we're offering the following APIs:</p>
            <div id="minibubbles">
              <div class="minibubble">
                <h3>Payments</h3>
                <p>Collecting money from your users is as easy as setting up a stripe account and writing a single line of code. You can then see trending metrics on this data.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="minibubble">
                <h3>User Authentication</h3>
                <p>Need your users to log in so that they can save and load their characters over time? You can securely store user data with us and flexibly verify usernames and passwords.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="minibubble">
                <h3>Metrics</h3>
                <p>How many people are playing your game? How many of those players are spending real money? How long does the average user play for? We can answer all that and much more.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <h2>Pricing</h2>
            <p>In exchange for using our demo and APIs, we ask that you distribute in our marketplace (after we review your game) and that we get a 2% cut on top of stripe's fees of all payments processed. You must process payments using our API.</p>
            <h2>More to come</h2>
            <p>This is heavily dependent on feedback, but here are some ideas that we have of what else we could build:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Cross-Game Chat: Add other users to your friends list and chat to them while playing other games hosted on Venzio.</li>
              <li>Common game elements: achievements, high scores, experience, levels, items, etc.</li>
              <li>Different Demo Types: We currently offer the skeleton of a 3D game, but we're interested in also offering skeletons for 2.5D (like Diablo or RuneScape), and side-scrolling (like Classic Mario or Maple Story games.</li>
              <li>Hosting: Don't worry about load balancing or scaling your servers as your multiplayer game grows.</li>
              <li>Cloud Storage: Want to store user data but don't want to worry about backing it up and scaling the data layer?</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Feedback</h2>
            <p class="padBottom">If you're interested in developing a game for our platform or you have any feedback, we'd love to hear from you! Please reach out at <a href="mailto:contact@venz.io">contact@venz.io</a>. Also, please check out our <a href="/demo">demo!</a></p>
