  "readme": "# Base.js Module\nThis is a modular version of Dean Edward's [Base.js](http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/03/base/). The same script will work the same in CommonJS Environments (such as [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)), AMD Environments (such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)), and plain browser environments.\n\nIn addition to modularizing the code I have also updated the entire implementation so that it passes [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) (with default settings in the installed version -- the web version turns on `strict` by default).\n\n# Getting Started\nThe first way to get started using the script is to simply include it wherever else you include scripts (be it at the top, bottom, through a script loader, or what have you):\n\n  <script src=\"/path/to/Base.js\"></script>\n\nThe second way to get started is to include the script as a dependency for an AMD application or module (using something such as [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/)):\n\n    require('/path/to/Base', function (Base) {\n      // You may now use Base.js as \"Base\" here.\n    });\n\nThe third and final way to get started is to `require` the module in a CommonJS environment (such as [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)):\n\n    var Base = require('./path/to/Base');\n\nIf you are using [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) with [npm](http://npmjs.org) then you can also install the module as follows:\n\n    npm install basejs\n\nThen in your script you only need to do the following:\n\n    var Base = require('basejs');\n\n# Defining Classes\nMoving forward, whichever path you chose above you should now have a `Base` object to work with. Basic usage is as follows:\n\n    // Define Animal class\n    var Animal = Base.extend({\n      constructor: function (name) {\n        this.name = name;\n      },\n      name: '',\n      eat: function () {\n        this.say('Yum!');\n      },\n      say: function (message) {\n        console.log((this.name !== '' ? this.name + ': ' : this.name) + message);\n      }\n    });\n\n    // Define the Cat class which extends Animal\n    var Cat = Animal.extend({\n      eat: function (food) {\n        if (food instanceof Mouse) {\n          this.base();\n        } else {\n          this.say('Yuk! I only eat mice.');\n        }\n      }\n    });\n\n    // Define a few more animals\n    var Mouse = Animal.extend();\n    var Dog = Animal.extend();\n\n    // Try out the classes\n    var kitty = new Cat('Kitty');\n    kitty.eat(new Mouse()); // logs \"Yum!\"\n    kitty.eat(new Dog()); // logs \"Yuk! I only eat mice.\"\n\nNotice the use of `this.base()`. `this.base()` is how you access the parent's method. This works in all methods (including constructors).\n\nYou can also define static (class-level) properties and methods:\n\n    var Circle = Shape.extend({ // instance properties / methods\n      constructor: function (x, y, radius) {\n        this.base(x, y);\n        this.radius = radius;\n      },\n      radius: 0,\n      getCircumference: function () {\n        return 2 * Circle.PI * this.radius;\n      }\n    }, { // class properties / methods\n      PI: 3.14\n    });\n\nFor more details including private data and singleton objects check out Dean Edward's [original documentation](http://dean.edwards.name/weblog/2006/03/base/).\n\n# License\n\n**The MIT License**\n\nBased on Base.js 1.1a (c) 2006 - 2010 Dean Edwards\nUpdated to pass JSHint and converted into a Module format by Kenneth Powers\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
